**Classes**: Defined various classes for ground vehicles and their respective categories (tracked, wheeled, amphibious, etc.).\n- **Properties**: Created object properties to link vehicles and bins, as well as data properties to define vehicle attributes.\n- **Individuals**: Added representative vehicles that belong to specific bins, with attributes like combat weight, maximum road speed, and power-to-weight ratio.\n- **Annotations**: Included human-readable labels and comments for clarity.\n\nThis structure serves as an ontology for the categorization and representation of ground vehicles, encapsulating features and relationships pertinent to simulation and analysis in military contexts.
